the idea in this project is to create a pokedex where I can filter and save the pokemons i will fetch and store from an api.
We essentialy would need 3 list, one for the pokemons selcted and one that holds the pokemons i receive from the api [maybe two arrays].
we would need an array to get all the types that pokemons can be.
this api will have on each pokemon and URL with more info about that pokemon in particular.
!!!UNDONE!!!i will need to think how to store the info from the pokemons after fetching it so that i can filter it By Id. (Compose a new array of objcts with pokemon id,name,types,Img).
We would need a Display cards Component to arrange the two arrays of cards nicely.
We would need a card component that renders the Img, Types, and name of the Pokemons that will be passed as prop.
We would need two filters: one should be a state that is a (form?) to compeare the serch bar with names as its written, the other an array of selected types(from the types array) that will filter the results based on the two filters.
